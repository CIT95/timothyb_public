## How-To Setup and Run 

1. Clone this repo locally

2.  Create a new virtual environment inside the directory, replacing dirname with whatever you'd like.
    <code>python3 -m venv dirname</code>

3. add .gitignore <br>in the dirname and place * in that file to not have any of the files tracked from within this folder.    

4. Activate virtual enivornment. Replace dirname with the name you used in step 2!</br>
    <code>source dirname/bin/activate </code>
    If you see your terminal show the name of the environment, then it worked properly!

5. Install required libraries with the following command.<br>
<code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>

6. Run the app! <br>
    <code>python password.py</code>
